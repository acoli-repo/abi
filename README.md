# Abikwanne

A Machine Reading system combining deep NLP and Linked Data developed 2014-2016 at the Applied Computational Linguistics (ACoLi) Lab at the Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, Germany. 

"Abikwanne" is an Acholi phrase for "I'm reading it".

As of 2022-03-12, the original Abikwanne repository has been archived. Use at your own risk. Please get in touch with [Christian Chiarcos](https://github.com/chiarcos) or [Christian Fäth](https://github.com/cfaeth) if you are interested in the original Abikwanne system or in contributing to the Abikwanne successor system.

We would like to thank previous Abikwanne contributors. Abikwanne has largely been a student project and it has been fun to develop. And beyond this, it has greatly contributed to the development of RDF-based NLP technologies, and its requirements have guided the development of [CoNLL-RDF](https://github.com/acoli-repo/conll-rdf), resp., [Fintan](https://github.com/Pret-a-LLOD/Fintan). However, the original code base won't be updated anymore and security issues will no longer be fixed. Since 2020, we have been developing a successor system based on Python and CoNLL-RDF/Fintan, stay tuned for future updates.
